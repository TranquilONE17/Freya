"""
Live public data about the world, read from a God's Eye View program
running on this machine.

God's Eye View (https://github.com/bilawalsidhu/gods-eye-view, MIT) is a
separate program the owner installs and starts. It gathers public feeds
(aircraft transponders, ship beacons, satellite orbits, earthquakes,
fires, storms, public cameras) and answers questions about them through
a local endpoint. Freya asks that endpoint; she does not fetch the feeds
herself, and she never starts or stops the program.

What leaves this machine is decided by that program: for a question
about a place, the place's name goes to a public place-name service and
the area to the feed that is asked. Nothing from memory or the
conversation is sent, only the few words the tool was given.

These are the first of Freya's tools whose answers come from the
internet. They exist only when the owner turns them on
(FREYA_WORLD_VIEW=1), every call goes through the broker, and what
comes back is untrusted text like any other tool result.
